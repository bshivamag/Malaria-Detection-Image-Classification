# Malaria-Detection-Image-Classification
We have a collection consisting of 19290 blood-cell images out of which 50% are Maleria-Parasite affected cells and 50% are healthy. 
We have to build a classifier model which can classify the cells based on their characteristics. 
We have a .CSV file (train.csv) which contains the title of each image in the column filename and the column label tells us which class the image blongs to, there are two classes- malaria & healthy
